# Lapsheets

This is a small project to create code that can merge several separate lapsheets
into a single results set. Lapsheets are used in scoring several types of racers
where racers complete multiple laps. Scoring these events can be tricky and so many
races have multiple scorers that keep a sheet a paper with each rider number as they
come through.
